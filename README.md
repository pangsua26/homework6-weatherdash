## Project Description
The purpose of this activity is to create a create a weather dashboard so the user can quickly research their selected city to determine the weather. The HTML will display a search bar, a selection of cities of which when submitted for a search, will display the city name, the current day, the city's: temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed and UV index. Additionally, the UV index will highlight different colors depending on how harmful the UV is that day. Lastly, below the main weather item, it will display the next 5 day forecast along with temperature, humidity and a weather icon depicting weather it will be sunny, cloudy, raining, etc.

## Experience
This activity was exceptionally difficult for a number of reasons:
1. I could not get the weather API to work using multiple api keys. 
2. I would get a function or code to show correctly in the console but then later on, it would no longer work. (This happened continously and I could not figure out why even when I back-tracked.)
3. Given the timeframe and overlap with Project 1 activities, for me, I felt like more time was needed.

Overall, I definitely fee like I am behind on the learning curve and will make more of an effort to start earlier and to ask more questions.
